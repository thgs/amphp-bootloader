## amphp-bootstrap

This is a package that provides a way to boot an Amphp HTTP server.
It exports configuration objects that are used as input and loaders for the config
for a few basic formats. It requires a container implementation to be adapted
to an interface, however some basic adapters are already provided for some container packages.
